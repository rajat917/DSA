⭐ COMMENTS :-

// This is single line COMMENTS
/* This is 
   multi line COMMENTS */


⭐ DATA TYPES :-
int, char, string, short, long, long long, float,
etc are knows as DataTypes.


⭐ VARIABLES :-
eg; int a;       // It means declaring the variable a with int data type.
    char b-9;
In these, a and b are variables.

int, long, long long is used for intergers.
float, double, long double is used for decimal numbers.

string s1; is used to take word (eg, hey i am rajat, then it will take only hey)
string str;
getline (cin, str);        is used to take whole line.


⭐ OPERATORS :-
mathematical expressions- +,-,*,/, etc.


⭐ CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS :-
if-else statements


⭐ TYPECASTING :-
eg: cout<<"a+b is" << (float) a+b <<endl;
here, 
     float is typecasted.


⭐ SWITCH STATEMENTS :-
switch (expression)
{
     case 1:
     /* expression*/
     break;

     default:
     /* expression*/
     break;
}


⭐ LOOPS :-
for, while, do while loops.


⭐ FUNCTIONS :-
int main() -  It is main function.
eg- add function
int add(int a, int b)
{
   int c;
   c = a + b;
   return c;  
}
Just like above we can create any function in the program.


⭐ ARRAYS :-
int arr[4] = {};

⭐ to include all the libraries of C++ use,
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>


⭐ Pass by Value and Refernce:
pass by value means send a copy to the Fucntion.
pass by Refernce means sending the original to function (to use it, just put % sign before the int)


⭐ Vector:
It is like dynamic array which is used to store the data but when they get filled full then it create new
vector of double size and copy all elements from prev to new vector.


⭐Max and Min Heap:
Heap is Data Structure.
Max heap prints maximum elements first to smallest
Min heap prints min element first to greatest
